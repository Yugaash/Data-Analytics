The goal of the project was to predict customer churn, meaning identifying customers who are likely to stop using a product or service. 
This helps businesses take preventive actions to retain customers.

Key Aspects of My Project:

Dataset: Likely obtained from a company's customer transaction or behavior data.
         Contained features such as customer demographics, purchase history, engagement levels, and service usage patterns.


Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values.
                    Feature engineering (creating new meaningful features).
                    Data normalization/scaling for machine learning models.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends, 
                                 Correlations,
                                 Influencing churn.

Used visualizations (e.g., histograms, heatmaps, box plots) to analyze customer behavior.

Model Selection & Training: Implemented machine learning models like Logistic Regression, 
                            Decision Trees, 
                            Random Forest.
                            
Evaluated models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.



Feature Importance & Optimization: Identified the most influential features affecting churn.
                                   Applied hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

Deployment & Business Impact: The final model could help businesses predict churners in advance and take actions like offering discounts or personalized engagement.
                              If deployed, the model would provide real-time churn predictions.
