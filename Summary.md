The Customer Churn Prediction Project successfully developed a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn with an accuracy of 27% .
The model evaluates customer behavior trends based on key factors like MonthlyCharges, Tenure, ContractType, and InternetService. 
Customers with higher monthly charges, shorter tenure, and month-to-month contracts were identified as being at a higher risk of churn. 
The confusion matrix highlights the modelâ€™s performance, with strong precision and recall values. 
Visual insights revealed that 27% of customers churned, with significant correlations between high monthly charges and churn. 
Actionable recommendations include offering discounts to high-paying customers, implementing loyalty programs for short-tenure customers, and improving service quality for Fiber Optic internet users. 
These results empower businesses to proactively reduce churn, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve long-term profitability.
